Using GROMACS with chemlab
==========================

GROMACS is one of the most used packages for molecular simulations, chemlab can provide a modern and intuitive interface for input and analysis purposes.
To illustrate the concepts we'll perform a simulation of liquid water.

In order to run a minimum simulation GROMACS requires to know some basic properties of our system. First of all, we have to provide gromacs the dimensions and the positions of our particles (coordinate file),
information about the connectivity between particles along with the intra-molecular interactions (topology file). Once we set the propertiees of the system all we need to do is performing a simulation, and 
this will require us to give parameters on how we want to make the system evolve (mdp parameter file).

chemlab effectively help us to generate in a flexible way a coordinate file for our system, there are multiple ways of doing that, we will just pick one. Read the comments:

>>> from chemlab.core import System
>>> from chemlab.graphics import display_system
>>> from chemlab.data.moldb import water

warning -> from_lattice is not implemented yet !
>>> s = System.from_lattice(water, size=4, density=1.0)
>>> display_system(s)
